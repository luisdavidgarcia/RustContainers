# RustContainers

RustContainers is an educational project aimed at creating a straightforward container-based system leveraging Rust's performance and safety features. This project serves as a practical exploration into the fundamentals of containerization and virtualization technologies, simulating a minimalistic version of Docker-like functionality. By developing a basic container system, contributors and learners can gain hands-on experience with the underlying mechanisms that enable containerization, such as namespaces and cgroups, all within the context of Rust's ecosystem. The use of Docker in the project setup ensures a uniform development and testing environment, facilitating a focus on learning and experimentation with container technologies. This initiative not only fosters a deeper understanding of operating system concepts but also showcases the versatility of Rust in system-level programming tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker
- Rust and Cargo

The provided setup script will guide you through installing Rust, Cargo, and Docker if they are not already installed on your system.

### Setup

NOTE: You must be using a Linux environment to make full use of the container, otherwise the program will fail, as it was not developed for any other operating system yet. 

To set up your local development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:luisdavidgarcia/RustOSProjects.git
   cd RustOSProjects
   ```

2. **Make the setup script executable**

    ```sh
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```

3. **Run the setup script**

    ```sh
    ./setup.sh
    ```

This script will install any missing prerequisites (such as Rust, Cargo, and Docker), set up pre-commit hooks for code quality, and prepare your Docker environment.

## Developing

After running the setup, you can start developing immediately. The repository is structured as follows:

- `src/:` Source files for your Rust projects.
- `Docker/`: Contains Docker-related scripts, including a Docker environment setup script.
- `scripts/`: Other utility scripts that might be helpful during development.

## Developing with VSCode and Remote - Containers

To further simplify your development process, we recommend using VSCode's Remote - Containers extension. This allows you to develop inside a Docker container, ensuring a consistent and fully-configured development environment.

### Getting Started with Remote - Containers

1. **Install the Remote - Containers extension** in VSCode.
2. **Open the project folder** in VSCode.
3. **Reopen the folder in a container:** VSCode may prompt you to reopen the folder in a container when it detects the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration. If not, you can open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and select "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container..."

### Benefits

- Consistent development environment across all project members.
- No need to install project dependencies locally â€” everything runs inside the container.
- Debug, run, and test your code in an environment that mirrors production.

## Using Docker

Your development environment is containerized to ensure consistency. To work with Docker:

- **Building the Docker image**:

The setup script takes care of building your Docker image initially. If you need to rebuild it manually:

```sh
docker build -t rustosprojects .
```

- **Running your Docker container**:

The Docker setup script also handles running your container. To manually start your container:

```sh
docker run -dit --name rustos_dev -v "$(pwd):/workspace" rustosprojects
```

- **Attaching to your Docker container:**

```sh
docker attach rustos_dev
```
